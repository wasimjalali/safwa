 * Core rule: one logical question per handle. Continuation fragments fold into
 * that one question; anything beyond it is flagged as an extra question.
 *
 * processComment() is the SINGLE source of truth for pipeline order:
 *   normalize -> continuation check -> duplicate check -> new/extra -> (render).
 * Both content.js (live) and the test runner (mocks) call it, so the order is
 * never duplicated and can never drift.
 *
 * Order is not negotiable. Continuation is checked BEFORE duplicate and BEFORE
 * the extra-question rule, so a split question is never misclassified as either.
